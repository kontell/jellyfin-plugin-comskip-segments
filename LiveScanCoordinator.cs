/// scan.
///
/// A live job is launched exactly like <see cref="Comskip.ComskipRunner"/> launches a
/// normal one (same args, same work dir, same output-file naming), except it is never
/// awaited to completion — the intent is that Comskip's own <c>live_tv=1</c> mode tails a
/// growing file and only exits when the process is killed, flushing a valid,
/// continuously-updated partial .edl to disk the whole time (confirmed in testing:
/// readable even after a hard kill).
///
/// In practice, confirmed live against a real recording, Comskip can also exit ON ITS OWN
/// well before the recording finishes — observed exiting after ~2 minutes of a 21-minute
/// recording, apparently hitting comskip.ini's <c>live_tv_retries</c> limit on a pause in
/// the writer's pacing (the ini's own comment suggests raising it, e.g. "Change to 16 when
/// using live_tv in BTV"). A self-exited process's .edl only covers whatever it saw before
/// it gave up — silently trusting it as "the" result for the whole recording would be
/// **worse** than not having this feature at all. So every path that would hand a job's
/// .edl to a caller first checks whether the process is still alive: still running means
/// we killed it ourselves because the recording actually settled (the intended path,
/// trustworthy); already exited on its own means the partial is unreliable and is
