# Patches jellyfin-web's index.html to load this plugin's browser-side scripts: the
# commercial-marker seek-bar overlay, and the item-details "Scan for commercials" menu
# entry.
#
# index.html is owned by root (installed by the jellyfin-web package), and the jellyfin
# service account can't write to it — that's why this is a script you run with sudo
# instead of something the plugin does for itself at startup.
#
# Safe to re-run, and safe to re-run after upgrading this plugin even if you already ran
# an older version of this script: each snippet below is independently checked against
# its own marker comment and only inserted if missing, so re-running after a plugin
# update that added a new snippet patches in just the new one, leaving anything already
# installed untouched.
#
# Re-run after every `jellyfin-web` package upgrade too — that package overwrites
# index.html wholesale, which silently drops every patch here. (The plugin's own log
# will warn you when this happens: look for "web patch is missing" in the Jellyfin log.)
#
# Usage: sudo ./install-overlay.sh [path-to-index.html]
#   Default path: /usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html
